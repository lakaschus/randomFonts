# Random Chinese Fonts generated by A.I.

## Work in progress

This Anki addon generates random Chinese fonts using a generative adversarial network from
https://github.com/kaonashi-tyc/zi2zi

The motivation is the following:

Your should learn vocabulary without relying on the association with the font/size/style of the character, because your brain will then connect two unrelated concept to each other. You should rather learn the 'essence' of the character. My proposal to enforce learning the essence of characters is by changing the style of character every time you see it. Another bonus is that every charater is something 'new', increasing the surprise effect and thus making it more fun to study. In this way you learn like a good Machine Learning algorithm that has a diverse dataset and is optimized to generalize, not overfit.
